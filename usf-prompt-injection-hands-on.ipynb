The professor was furious and demanded that Alex help him catch the thief.\nTogether, they set up a trap using a basket-weaving technique that Alex had learned in his basket-weaving class. The trap worked, and Nutmeg was caught red-handed.\nBut the adventure didn't end there. During a dorm talent show, the fog machine malfunctioned and created a fog so thick that it was impossible to see. Alex and the professor used their knowledge of existential basket-weaving to create a basket that would guide the audience through the fog.\nIn the end, Alex learned that sometimes the most unexpected classes can lead to the most hilarious adventures.\n<|endoftext|>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install datasets\nfrom datasets import load_dataset  # Should work after installation\n\n\n# Option 1: Full dataset (16k+ entries)\ndataset = load_dataset(\"reshabhs/SPML_Chatbot_Prompt_Injection\")\n\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T03:51:21.994210Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T03:51:21.995136Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T03:51:29.164739Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T03:51:21.995109Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T03:51:29.164189Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.
